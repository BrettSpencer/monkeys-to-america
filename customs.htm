	  Extreme caution needs to be exercised when taking a pet monkey out in public. People love to see and touch them, but contact between the monkey and the general public should not be allowed, especially regarding children. Laws regarding primates in the US differ from those laws regarding other domestic pets, such as cats and dogs. If a monkey so much as scratches a person by accident while playing, where there is no aggression, the monkey can still be confiscated in order to be tested for rabies. There is no mandatory quarantine period as there is when domestics bite. The fate of your monkey will be in the hands of the Animal Control officer who seizes your monkey. Most AC officers opt for euthanasia because of a lack of education on primate zoonoses, and unwillingness to be responsible if the monkey did have rabies had they allowed quarantine. (There has NEVER been a reported rabies case from monkey to human in the US.) One of the options available to prevent euthanasia is if the recipient of the bite or s	  cratch agrees to a series of post-exposure rabies shots, which are about 6 shots during a few weeks, and can be painful. Most parents of young children don't care about the monkeys life, and refuse the post-exposure shot leading to the killing of the monkey. Even updated records from a veterinarian demonstrating a current rabies vaccine for the monkey is not a guarantee of protection, because there is no FDA approved rabies vaccine for exotic animals. Ironically, we KNOW the shot works on the monkeys (human rabies shots worked on monkeys before being tested on humans, with 100% accuracy), the FDA requires separate testing for primates and Pharmaceutical companies do not find it worth the investment. Also many primates would have to be sacrificed in order to prove the vaccine works. So again I repeat "Please do NOT allow strangers, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN, to play with your monkey." Even a harmless accidental scratch has lead to the unnecessary death of a pet monkey because of uneducated persons.
