	<h2>Being Prepared</h2>
	<p>Being a monkey owner is <strong>NOT</strong> for everyone, it is for a rare type of person. I do not recommend anyone to obtain a primate, unless they have done the proper <strong>RESEARCH</strong>. Be clear about what a monkey is before you get one so that you won't be disappointed later. If you want a monkey as a novelty item, an attention gettter or a cross between a doll and a child, you may be very happy with an infant-but not with a growing or full-grown monkey
	</p>

	<p>Remember, monkeys are different than dogs and cats in that they do not retain "tameness" without a continued investment of time. Even with an investment of time, monkeys naturally progress to behaviors of adolescence and maturity that make them less compatible with most humans and their human households. They are A LOT of work! This page will give an outline of the responsibilities of owning a primate. If anyone has any additional comments/advice, please send me an <a href="mailto:bspencer411@hotmail.com?subject=Monkey%20Tips">email</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>The Commitment</h2>
	<p>Owning a primate is a LIFETIME COMMITMENT.  It is not fair to take an animal and not commit to providing it with care for the duration of its lifetime. Primate babies will bond to you immediately and you become their troop. You will be very important to them as they are social animals. They are very dependant on you and will demand from you constantly.  With a lifespan, for most, of 30+ years, it is your responsibility to provide for that new member for its entire life. It is your decision to own one, so be certain that monkey parenthood is right for you. It is more difficult for an adult monkey to adjust to a new owner, and more difficult to find someone with the experience necessary to "break in" and adult monkey. Learning to read their language and anticipating their moods is essential part of the "break in" and having these skills will stress yourself and the monkey less. In other words, finding someone to properly care for a monkey is not as easy as finding someone to take care of your dog or cat.
