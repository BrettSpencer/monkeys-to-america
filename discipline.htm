         <h2>That's a bad monkey.</h2>

	   A monkey's temperament depends on the nature of care provided to that monkey. A monkey who was given the time and consistent care required should not have an aggression problem. Not necessarily biting, but temper tantrums, such as loud screams, with a primate is comparable to a person being in a bad mood. I have learned to recognize their "language" and am able to tell if they are not in a good mood. Monkeys have different screams, and in the case of squirrels, various chirps, barks, and screams. You will learn which are good chirps, and which are bad ones. As an owner, you will learn what your monkey's rules are and when you can and can not break them. Some rules, i.e. grabbing tail, taking objects from them, may only apply to strangers. Joey, for instance, lets me do pretty much anything to him, but if a stranger walked over and took a piece of food from his hand they would probably be in trouble. A lot of their rules are common sense, and they vary from monkey to monkey.
	</br></br>
	   Monkeys require consistency and discipline, such as a firm "NO," or time out. Never hit a monkey, especially an adult. It will backfire on you. They will see it as a threat, and either become more upset or fear you. A relationship with a monkey is built on trust, security, and respect. You can never show fear, and always maintain your alpha/troop leader status. A feeling of security is important with monkeys. Most monkeys are nervous animals, which scare easily. A glass plate crashing on the floor, a loud truck passing by, and screams from another person are examples of things which can evoke a fear reaction from a monkey. They will turn to you for protection. If they are on another person and become scared you have to be very careful that you have control, or else the monkey may get upset at the person.

	   Understanding what sets off a monkeys temper is important. Similar to a dog who does not like to have his food touched by owners, but is very loving otherwise, so is the case with monkeys. In my research and experience I have found that monkeys become aggressive for 3 reasons 1) territorial (taking a prized item from their cage while cleaning), Dominance (to establish their rank among the family), and out of fear. I believe firmly in changing the nature of care provided rather than changing the monkey or giving him up. If a dog doesn't like his food touched and will bite a hand who comes near it, the owner simply does not disturb the dog while he eats. Same logic with monkeys. If a monkey does not like their territory invaded (removing items during cleaning) then having a lockout box, or separate cage can be added for cleaning the cage. Simple as that.
